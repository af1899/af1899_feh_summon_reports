# Intro
> This is a summary to explain why I'm pulling on this banner and who for, as well as plans.

Sara is one of my besties in the *Fire Emblem* series, of which I'm highly fond of since I began playing around 9 years ago.

When she got her first alt, I was overjoyed, even though she's just delegated as a cheerleader of a dual unit, but she's paired up with another one of the characters that I like in the series: Linde.

The artwork, quotes and their [Paralogue] conversations really got me excited to pull on the day of the banner, so I decided to work on a new merge project... well, until I pulled the plug with *FEH* anyway.

I also accounted utility at the time, and I think they helped a lot during *Thracia 776* and *Mystery of the Emblem* seasons in [Resonant Battles], filling in the blanks when either game was the bonus.

# Commentary

17 5★s in a bit over `600` [Orbs] isn't so much of a terrible deal, it could've gone better, yeah, specially since one of them is a dud, but 6 out of 11 copies of a merge project in a banner that has color share on red of all things is some nice luck still.

They made it to +5 and that's as far as I could get them, I'm happy with the progress even if I didn't wait to +10 them... but well, Rearmed Sonya would've likely changed plans anyway.
