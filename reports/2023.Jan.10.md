# Explanation
> This is a summary to explain why I'm pulling on this banner and who for, as well as plans.

Sara is one of my biggest favorites in the *Fire Emblem* series, of which I'm highly fond of since I began playing around 9 years ago, when she got her first alt, I was overjoyed, even though she's just delegated as a cheerleader of a dual unit, but she's paired up with another one of my favorites in the series: Linde.
The artwork, quotes and their [Paralogue] conversations really got me excited to pull on the day of the banner, so I decided to work on a new merge project.

I'm not just pulling for favorites, but this'll hopefully let me score better during *Thracia 776* and *Mystery of the Emblem* seasons in [Resonant Battles], being also my most merged Harmonized Hero and one that can provide an extra option for both games in [Limited Hero Battles] (specially the latter as I'm a tad lacking of good *MotE* units).

The plan was to focus on getting them merges so I was sniping red stones all the time they were available, in circles they weren't, green would be chosen first, then blue and colorless only in all-colorless circles, which is an unlucky and unlikely to happen, but possible scenario.

# Statistics

* **Initial [Orbs]**:
  * **Visible:** `330`
  * **Stashed:** `82`
  * **Total:** `412`
* **Spent [Orbs]**: `607`
* **Refill count:** `31` (this is the amount of times I needed to grind from my emergency stash to have 20+ [Orbs] in case a full round of red stones appears, also explains how's there more spent [Orbs] than the initial count. This value equals to `recordings - 1`)
* **Peak rate:** `4.00%`
* **Total of pulls by color:**
  * **Red:** `108`
  * **Blue:** `4`
  * **Green:** `18`

* **Obtained 5★ units:**
  * **Khadein Linde+Sara copies:** `6/11`
  * **Other focuses:** `3`
  * **Pitybreakers:** `4`
  * **Pseudo-demotes:** `4`
  * **Total:** `17`

# :thinking: Final thoughts and reflections

17 5★s in a bit over `600` [Orbs] isn't so much of a terrible deal, it could've gone better, yeah, specially since one of them is a dud, but 6 outta 11 copies of a merge project in a banner that has color share on red of all things is some nice luck still, I feel really satisfied with them being halfway done in merges and I'm excited to finish them.

# :gun: Summoning plans

In the end I decided to **not** to pull for them until next year, so that I can focus on other goals for 2023. The original plan before the trailer came up was to save for Spring Sonya, while Duo Spring Idoun is fated to get a refine now that Duo Halloween Hector has his, it's not a strong necessity that she gets merges when the next rerun comes around, what's more, surprises like these can be nasty to one's plans, but that's what's saving is for after all, putting the willpower of the F2P player to the test.

Back to the topic, unlike Duo Spring Idoun, who's at +4 as of this report. Spring Sonya never got any merges, she's proven to be extremely helpful and could always benefit from merges, so that's my next goal after this.
