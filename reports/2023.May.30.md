# Explanation

For this summoning session, I didn't record a video since I needed time for other activities and didn't plan for it, also it being a minor session.
Admiteddly, I used to make videos for a few short summoning sessions like [this one](https://youtu.be/nHxqm_bbssc), but I feel these give little time to actually enjoy, so... here we are.

After Legendary Hinoka was announced, I decided to splurge in this banner, having managed to only spend my visible savings while my stash remains untouched for some time.

# Statistics
> :warning: [Focus Charges] were available but not used.

> :information_source: 5 summons were done on the day the banner began, but after that I held back until the Legendary Hero trailer showed up.

# :gem: Getting the Forma

[Palla](https://fireemblem.fandom.com/wiki/Palla) is my favorite member of the [Whitewings](https://fireemblem.fandom.com/wiki/Whitewings) for a number of reasons, but let's say I'm really comfortable with her personality, and she's pretty.

In any case, I've planned to get her Forma now that she has a really good defensive build going on, I'll update this report soon as I get 'er, but she'll be +3 and have attack and resistance assets.

# :thinking: Final thoughts and reflections

This summoning session actually went pretty well, kind of a rough start but it didn't take long to get a few 5★s, I don't think my rate went above 3.5%, but unfortunately, I didn't keep track of that.

And before the spark, I got two copies, which was amazing.
