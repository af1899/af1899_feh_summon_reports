## ABOUT THIS DOCUMENT
I'm `af1899`, a former regular user at GamePress Community that plays the *Fire Emblem Heroes* mobile game, and I've decided I'll create a repository in which I'll post detailed reports of my pulls with Markdown format, for anyone that's interested on detailed statistics and that kind of stuff.

This is the first report you'll see here.

Refer to my YouTube channel for videos on past summonings and other stuff that might interest you:

## NOTES BEFORE LISTINGS
* A number of recordings were done while summoning to analyze, get stats and share, I identify each one with numbers, with the oldest starting first to the newest going up to `n`.
* I order each recording by modification date and start selecting with `[Shift]`+`{any directional arrow}` from the oldest until the newest to get the identifying number of that recording, by looking at the number of selected items, the recordings should be kept on a folder where there's nothing else, so that the last recording to be selected is the newest and is equal to `n` (total of files within the folder).
* Timestamps are for **original** recordings, **not** post-processed, these will give an idea to the reader of how long were those summoning marathons, but not an exact amount of time spent, since I don't track that, the FFWing speed is stated on video.
* If you'd like to watch the summoning marathon, you may watch the video [right here](https://youtu.be/iHEPfRghETc).

### *"Only got garbage"*
*There's a final total of `33` recordings, most of these just show what I got every time I came back to pull after gathering 20+ [Orbs] in Lucina&Robin's banner, the clip IDs listed below belong to videos that show I got lower rarity units, all of them are featured in order during the final AIO video at much faster speeds except during times a 5★ is acquired (time is temporarily restored back to normality in order to comment and give the viewer time to read and check the IVs).*

* **Recording numbers:** `1`, `4`, `5`, `6`, `7`, `8`, `9`, `10`, `11`, `12`, `13`, `14`, `17`, `18`, `19`, `20`, `21`, `22`, `23`, `24`, `25`, `26`, `27`, `28`, `29`, `30`, `31`.
* **Notice:** `1` is the one showing freebies, from `4` until `32` are pulls with emergency savings (from [Story Maps]), `33` is for the summoning session below:

## 3RD - ASCENDED IDOUN

* **Initial [Orbs]**:
  * **Visible:** `41`
  * **Stashed:** `6`
  * **Total:** `47`
* **Spent [Orbs]**: `37`
* **Peak rate:** `3.25%`
* **Total of pulls by color:**
  * **Red:** `0`
  * **Blue:** `13`
  * **Green:** `0`
  * **Colorless:** `1`
* **Obtained 5★ units:**
  * **Ascended Idoun copies:** `2`
  * **Other focuses:** `0`
  * **Special:** `0`
  * **Pitybreakers:** `0`
  * **Total:** `2`

### List of obtained units

* Ascended Idoun (-att/+res) ― `02:42` in recording `#33`.
* Ascended Idoun (-hp/+att) ― `03:56` in recording `#33`.

## TRIVIA AND TOTALS
* `235` [Orbs] were spent in [Here with Me] from the savings, together with [Weekly Revival 42], this totals `492` [Orbs], plus the other `4` spent before the actual summon marathon on [Here with Me] during free pull rounds, totalling `496` [Orbs] out of the `500` I started with.
* After that, I relied on [Story Maps] and any temporary source (i.e.: events and quests) in order to gather the 20+ [Orbs] before pulling, between those sources, a total of `248` was spent, with the `235` from before, this pools together a final total of `483` [Orbs] spent here.
* `496` (from savings) + `248` (from grind for banner 2) + `37` (from savings spent for Ascended Idoun) = `781` [Orbs] spent **between all 3 banners**, that's about two and half months worth of [Orbs] in average, and then some more!
* In that amount, only 19 5★s were obtained between those banners, 6 of which were specials, 4 pitybreakers and 9 focus units. *`*`sigh`*`* That certainly was one tough luck with the Valentine's units unfortunately, but it turned out alright and I got everyone I wanted, plus Idoun getting an Ascended version and amazing luck made my day on her debut.
* **During the grind for Lucina and Robin:** I was taking the stats after the main recording, and noticed that after that, there was never a circle with more than two green stones, at best, that was the amount I got in a single round, and there were only 4, while colorless only showed up 4 times in 2 rounds.

## REMINDERS
* On the 1st banner: base rate is 4% and ups by .33% every 5 pulls.
* On the 2nd and 3rd banner: base rate is 3% and ups by .25% every 5 pulls.
