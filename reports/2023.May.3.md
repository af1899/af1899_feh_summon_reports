# Intro

May 3rd, 2023 is the day at which Ascended Idoun returned once more, along with some others that I was hoping I could get, namely...
* Ascended Ishtar.
* Ascended *FEW3H* Hilda.
* Ascended Florina.

My Idoun was +5 and Ishtar +3, and since I had 496 [Orbs], I thought I'd pull to get some merges for them (but specially Idoun) and hopefully collect the others via backup pulls.

#### Footnotes

1) On the video, I listed him with the wrong IVs, because I mistook them somehow. But look closely at the IVs when his profile is shown and you'll see the correct ones. You can see it at [`7:51`](https://youtu.be/AVFiRo3Ll5A?t=471).

# Commentary

The sole fact I forgot about the stashed [Orbs] feels... well... rather dumb, I could've probably avoided grinding that emergency stash, but not that it's an entirely regrettable decision, and I could get the last merge right as I had just a few sources left from [Chain Challenges]...

So, I got 13 5★ units in 567 [Orbs], out of which 5 were Ascended Idoun merges, and I say: I'm actually happy I got to +10 yet another exclusive, but not any one, none less than the Idoun alt I long yearned for, one where we could truly see her smile and become a new person after the events of *FE6*.

Getting two Ishtar copies was also a treat, she became +5 and was halfway done in merges.

In the end, she made it to +6 before I quitted the game permanently, but I'm still satisfied I made it far with her.
