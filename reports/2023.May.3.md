# Explanation

May 3rd, 2023: this is the day at which Ascended Idoun returns, along with some others that I was hoping I could get, namely...
* Ascended Ishtar
* Ascended *FEW3H* Hilda
* Ascended Florina

My Idoun was +5 and Ishtar +3, and since I had 496 [Orbs], I thought I'd pull to get some merges for them (but specially Idoun) and hopefully collect the others via backup pulls.

# :thinking: Final thoughts and reflections

Damn... the sole fact I forgot about the stashed [Orbs] feels... well... rather dumb, I could've probably avoided grinding that emergency stash, but not that it's an entirely regrettable decision, and I could get the last merge right as I had just a few sources left from [Chain Challenges]...

So, I got 13 5★ units in 567 [Orbs], out if which 5 of these units were Ascended Idoun merges, and I'll say, I'm actually happy I got to +10 yet another exclusive, but not any one, none less than the Idoun alt I long yearned for, one where we could truly see her smile and become a new person after the events of *FE6*.
Getting two Ishtar copies was also a treat, she became +5 and is halfway done in merges, can't say I'll stick long enough to +10 her though, but I'm sastisfied with the progress I made on her so far.

# :gun: Summoning plans

Considering there's been no signs of the Jugdral characters I'm looking to get this year making it into *FEH*, and that the Special Heroes this month will likely be of little interest (Bridal/Groom alts) + the recently announced Fallen Heroes that tend to be easy skip, I've decided to simply save and hopefully be able to easily build up some savings, if Idoun gets a 4th alt before I quit, it'd be nice to at least collect it.

If no one of my interest target units show up along the way, my next goal would be in 10 months after this report was made (for Spring Idoun)... provided I'd stick around to play *FEH* 'till then, but time will tell 'bout that.
There's also the chance Patty from *FE4* will debut next year considering the pattern Intelligent Systems has held up with units from that game so far, and I'd love to get her as well.
