# Intro
Starting July/2022, I've pulled through various banners, but 5 of them didn't have a video of their own because I couldn't find the time to do them before.

Rather than making 5 time-consuming videos for each, I've made a test edit, in which I just summarize my pulls on all 5 sessions, the detailed reports are as follows.

I've pulled on this banner because of the green and colorless pools, there were a lot of interesting choices, particularly on colorless where all 3 focus units were people I wanted to collect/merge, and I like Ninian, so I thought I'd try to get them but without going all out.

3 5★s in `99` [Orbs] isn't a bad trade-off, it's too unfortunate I had built quite a pity before getting Tine and, in the same round, Xander, but it wasn't so terrible, and I could give Tine a better boon.

### List of obtained units

| Unit | IVs | Type at time | Note(s) |
| :- | :- | :- | :- |
| Rearmed Female Robin | +HP/-spd | Focus | Fodder chance used to give Idoun the following: [Arcane Grima] and [A/S Near Save 3]. |
| Eleonora | +HP/-res | Pseudo-demote | Fodder TBA. |
| Yarne | +res/-HP | Pseudo-demote | Will be used in a future inheritance chain in which [Atk/Spd Solo 4] is going to be extracted. |
| Ascended Eir | +HP/-res | Focus | ~~In this house we don't know what's foddering Eir.~~ |
| Rearmed Female Robin | +att/-def | Focus | Fodder chance used to give Ascended Idoun the following after foddering a Legendary Fae to Robin: [Arcane Grima], [Distant Stance] and [Def/Res Menace]. Robin was merged to +1 +att at this time. |
| Ascended Eir | +att/-def | Focus | In the 39th pull, I got her with perfect IVs, I've decided to use this copy as base for merging, as +att is a super asset, +spd would be her secondary asset. |
| Ascended Eir | *Sparked* | Focus | This brought her to +2 merges. |

## :information_source: About this banner
> Banner details: [*see wiki*](https://feheroes.fandom.com/wiki/Special_Rearmed_Robin_%26_More).

Let's first recall that [Rearmed Heroes](https://feheroes.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Rearmed_Heroes) can be foddered only once, including their weapon and any skills they have, whether or not they're part of their base kit, **without losing the unit**, however this is doable once, and foddering the unit a second time to lose them isn't possible.

Considering this, I've decided to pull for Robin and Eir (my favorite OC in *FEH*), I adore Robin and this has proven to be a chance to collect some highly useful skills too, and an [Ascendant Floret] to decide the secondary boon of my Legendary Julia later on.

For what was spent, the value acquired from it was amazing, it allowed me to deck out my best girl in her Ascended alt with new skills and expand her OG form's collection with rare fodder, including an [Arcane Weapon].
Plus, Eir's alt was truly heartwarming, she's smiling even more than in past instances and her story with Ymir was pretty sweet, albeit short and expandable.

In here, things took a bit of an L, but it's not like it went... bad, just kind of mixed, the 3 merges acquired within the 40+ pulls are a delight though, can't really complain about luck here.
I've decided to save after this since I didn't find myself confident in pressing any further, and I thought there could be more banners I'd want to pull on, which turned out to be true.

### List of obtained units

| Unit | IVs | Type at time | Note(s) |
| :- | :- | :- | :- |
| Fallen Ninian | +spd/-HP | Focus | Would eventually be a merge. |
| Mareeta | +spd/-HP | Pseudo-demote | Will be used as base for merges, also +spd is a super asset. |
| Volke | +spd/-def | Pitybreaker | Eventually foddered to Kagero for [Lethality], [Sturdy Impact] and [Time's Pulse 2]. |
| Ascended Fjorm | +def/-res | Focus | Foddered to Winter Hilda. |
| Hinoka | -att/+def | Pseudo-demote | She's just asking to be foddered for [Hone Fliers] at this point. :trollface: |
| Ascended Mareeta | *Sparked* | Focus | Yes, again I had to spark her to get a copy. Merged BTW. |
| Knight Chrom | *Neutral* | Pseudo-demote | Fodder TBA. |
| Delthea | +HP/-def | Pseudo-demote | Merge. |
| Fallen Ninian | +HP/-def | Focus | Used as base for merging her, resulting in +1 +HP, she'd also replace OG Ninian until she gets her refine, but who knows since I.S. never gave one to refreshers... |
| Ascended Fjorm | +spd/-att | Focus | Foddered to Ascended Idoun. |

Indeed, I.S. goofed up and [didn't notify us of this banner coming up in the schedule](https://feheroes.fandom.com/wiki/New_Event_Calendar_Is_Here!_(Nov_2022)_(Notification)), you can try looking for it in here. It came up 13 days after I pulled for Ascended Idoun, so 11/24/2022. If you're reading this, I'd recommend taking this one as a warning after we get some more Ascended Heroes, you can expect this banner coming up near the end of the month with more Ascended Heroes previously added.

Anyway, I was somewhat ready for it even though I didn't have much saved up, mainly due to spending about two weeks before this banner came up.
And let's say that unlike previous ones, this one was quite a pain, even with the base rate of it being 6% and increasing by .5% every 5 pulls, but the worst offender is again, only getting Ascended Mareeta via the spark feature, it's unfortunate.
Least there's some good fodder obtained out of it and Fallen Ninian would become a valuable dancer to use with my Sonya, I happened to have [Infantry Pulse 3] to spare too.
Overall, it was a summoning marathon that I had mixed feelings with.

### List of obtained units

| Unit | IVs | Type at time | Note(s) |
| :- | :- | :- | :- |
| Hector | +att/-def | Pseudo-demote | Would be eventually foddered as part of a chain to give both Ascended Idoun and Rearmed Female Robin the [Distant Stance] skill, along with others. |
| Rearmed Ophelia | +HP/-res | Focus | Fodder chance used to give Sophia the following: [Arcane Eclipse], [Special Spiral 4] and [Atk/Res Finish 2]. Copy will be kept for [HM] grind when the cap raises. |
| Priam | +spd/-def | Pitybreaker | Foddered to Sophia for [Atk/Def Ideal 4] and [Null Follow-Up 3]. |
| Ymir | +HP/-res | Pitybreaker | A blessed one for sure even if her IVs ain't great. Merge. |
| Seiðr | *Sparked* | Focus | Another one I could only get via spark. |

This one has left me with bittersweet feelings, the best profit made out of it is all of the upgrades Sophia got from two people, she's doing a lot better as a result, and she needed it considering her refine being so outdated.

But on the other hand, it's an accident that could've avoided: I originally planned to pull for Rearmed Ophelia because I thought Sonya could finally get an amazing upgrade to her weapon... well, that's went to waste, but **after** I've pulled.
I was so careless to have pulled on this banner, it was too late before I knew it; the other reason I had to pull on this one is because of Seiðr, she's really set a solid first impression and had her own goofy moments despite her best efforts to stick to her role as a goddess.

Still, it's not like it's a completely regrettable mess, it's served as a permanent reminder to consider details like this when it comes to planning.
