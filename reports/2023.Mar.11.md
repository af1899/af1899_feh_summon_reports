# Explanation

As you may know, Sonya is my second best girl in the series, her first alt after 4 years made me really happy, but unfortunately and for some unholy reason, she's been always hard to get, in the original run, [I pulled for her](/2022.Mar-Apr.md#hop-and-go-seek) and only got the sparked copy.

Now, back to this banner after a year, I've decided to save for it in hopes I could give my Spring Sonya a desirable boon and some stat boosts through merges.

# :thinking: Final thoughts and reflections

17 5★ units and a copy of the semi-demote from the banner, in a little over 600 [Orbs] is an alright tradeoff, but it was still rough to some extent, specially during the first half.
Most units I've obtained here do carry some valuable fodder that I certainly plan to make use of, but both Dieck and Edelgard were already foddered to Idoun so that her collection keeps growing.
