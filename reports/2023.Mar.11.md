# Intro

As you may know, Sonya is my second best girl in the series &mdash; her first alt after 4 years made me really happy.

Coming back to this banner after a year, I've planned to pull on it in hopes I could give my Spring Sonya a desirable boon and some stat boosts through merges.

# Commentary

17 5★ units and a copy of the semi-demote from the banner, in a little over 600 [Orbs] is an alright tradeoff, but it was still rough to some extent, specially during the first half.

Most units I've obtained here do carry some valuable fodder that I made use of &mdash; both Dieck and Edelgard were already foddered to Idoun so that her collection could grow some more.
