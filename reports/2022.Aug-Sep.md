# Commentary

This time around I got `20` 5★s for a total of `912` [Orbs] across three banners, a significantly bigger amount than [last time](2022.Mar-Apr.md)... when I think about it, it leaves a bittersweet impression to me about this summoning spree, but in the end, I'm highly satisfied with the fact I +10ed my "third best girl" in her Legendary iteration, the very one that's the staple of my growing love and appreciation for Julia herself. :purple_heart:

It was also nice just to get Deirdre even if the IVs suck, at least I could admire her when I liked... and I still can, from the distance.
