# :thinking: Final thoughts and reflections

This time around I got `20` 5★s for a total of `912` [Orbs] across three banners, a significantly bigger amount than what's shown in [the previous report](2022.Mar-Apr.md), when I think about it, it leaves a bittersweet impression to me about this summoning spree, but in the end, I'm highly satisfied with the fact I +10ed my "third best girl" in her Legendary iteration, the very one that's the staple of my growing love and appreciation for Julia herself. :purple_heart:

It was also nice just to get Deirdre even if the IVs suck, at least I can slowly work on her and simply admire her when I like.

# :gun: Summoning plans

Next up... is Ascended Idoun, her debut event is rerunning early in Nov/2022, and I'd absolutely love to +10 the bestest girl, so yeah let's go. :sunglasses:

I originally thought of saving for a couple of [Lantern Breath+] copes some of my units need, but this rerun has made those plans take an L, besides there's no hurry to get it anyway because the units that need them already have decent enough kits, so it's fine.
