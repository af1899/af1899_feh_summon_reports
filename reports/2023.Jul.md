# Commentary

I first started to pull for Summer Ymir+Eir with the intention to secure them, just for the sake of collecting. Eir is my favorite OC in the game and I consider Ymir a close second.

After [Spring Idoun's rerun](#spring-idouns-rerun) was over, I decided to wait until our next Mythic Hero was revealed and 'till the last days of my account ownership before I kept pulling for the Duo.

The Mythic Hero was eventually revealed to be [Freyr](https://feheroes.fandom.com/wiki/Freyr:_Dream-King), a guy long overdue to become playable but is finally in... I decided to skip and keep going for the Duo instead, and...

...It was a good session, specially considering that it was the true last session that I did, unless you don't count the post-Freyr-reveal continuation.

I got everyone in the banner and got to enjoy playing with Ivy a little, the Duo naturally saw a lot more use and even with the worst IV set they could get and mergeless, they performed greatly, but of course, that's what you could expect from a powercreep unit.

As for Spring Idoun's rerun banner... I regret to inform that I walked away from it with a 4% pity and couldn't break it, I was low on [Orbs] at the time and didn't have the energy to grind for more... that, and I forgot the banner itself &mdash; shows that I already wanted to quit *FEH* soon as I could.

However, these are all of the people I got, and though I'm kind of mixed about those results, in the end I got 3 copies of Spring Idoun, making her +7, along with the refine.

I could ever complete her, but I'm happy to have made a lot of progress with her during my stay, and hey I still have the other two variants +10ed.

As for the other pulls, it was a painful session, specially because of Perceval getting in the way every now and then, plus circles with no reds were getting frequent during the first half an hour or so I spent summoning.
