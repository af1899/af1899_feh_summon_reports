Breakdown of summons by color per banner will be offered (the number is the year of the {Choose Your Legends} banner), but since only all F2P freebies were redeemed, there aren't peak rate and [Orbs] spent statistics listed.

# Final thoughts and reflections

While `20` 5★s for an amount as large as `639` [Orbs] that were spent across two months isn't a great trade-off, I'd say it went pretty well actually, since they all had either good fodder or are a merge of a project like Erinys, who eluded me on her rerun unfortunately.
Besides, I got all of the units I wanted despite the awful RNG and my scarce sources as an F2P, it's in times like these I'm grateful the spark was indeed implemented, though I wish that it wasn't a [Feh Pass] feature for some of the banners, but alas, I understand Intelligent Systems needs sales to rise up again or else their game is dying.

I'm certain I want to save up after this ~~unless Intelligent Systems decides on making "Mythic Idoun", then yeah my [Orbs] are as good as dead~~.

# Plans

As of this report, I don't plan to fodder anyone marked as fodder in the video yet, because I don't have confirmed recipients and I'd like to see how far can I grind their [HM] before that happens.
...Well, I did fodder Brave Lyn and Charlotte to Tine actually haha... ^^
