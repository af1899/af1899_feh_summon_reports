> :bulb: Here's where you place all of the statistical counts regarding your summons on a specific banner. You're best first recording the whole summon (you could plug your device to a computer and use [Scrcpy](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy) if your screen recorder is prone to crash) to gather the statistics, this ensures no room for error as you can double-check everything, and you can even decide if you want to make a video or not.

### List of obtained units

| Unit | IVs | Type at time | Note(s) |
